*Programming and Algorithmics 2* (summer semester 2018/2019)

------------

This repository contains some of my code for assignments, exam preparation and other stuff.

Contents:
- ```sw/``` - semestral work
- ```progtest/``` - weekly assignments

The syllabus of this course was focused on the following:
- **c++, non-object-oriented extensions.**
- **operator overloading, inheritance, oop**
- **abstract classes, exceptions, polymorphism**
- **templates**
- **specification and implementation of abstract data types.**
- **stream library, serialization of objects.**
- **event-driven program, QT library.**

Each week of the semester we received a new homework to work on. This homework was then uploaded to "Progtest" server, that would do all sorts of tests including space/memory complexity, wrong inputs, huge data inputs, memory management - the server would then calculate a point summary to each task.
